/**
 * OS sandbox — types and the executor interface.
 *
 * **Design:** §5.2 / §7. v0 ships the *six bash
 * validators* (permission/syntax/path/redirect/
 * destructive/quote), which enforce the policy at
 * the command-parse level. The OS sandbox is a
 * second layer of enforcement — kernel-level
 * (landlock, namespace) — that wraps the actual
 * command execution.
 *
 * **T3.4 scope:** the *seam* only. v0 ships:
 * - `SandboxExecutor` interface
 * - `NoopSandboxExecutor` (default; the bash tool
 *   still uses the 6 validators but no kernel
 *   enforcement)
 *
 * The `LandlockSandboxExecutor` (Linux 5.13+) and
 * the `ProcessNamespaceSandboxExecutor` (POSIX,
 * needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN or unshare(1)) land in
 * follow-up sub-chunks T3.4.1 and T3.4.2. They
 * require a Linux test environment to validate
 * the actual kernel enforcement; shipping them
 * without a Linux test would be a lie about what
 * we can prove.
 *
 * **Why ship the seam first:** the bash tool
 * already has the seam (`sandboxPolicy` is in
 * `ToolContext`; `ToolRegistry` already has 6
 * validators; the gap is the kernel-level
 * executor). A small `SandboxExecutor` interface
 * + a noop default lands the shape; the landlock
 * impl drops in as a back-end detail (the bash
 * tool doesn't change).

 * - Native file ops the bash tool doesn't see
 *   (e.g. a hook on the bash tool can edit a

 *   `tee(1)` call).
 * The kernel sandbox (landlock: deny write to
 * `/etc`) catches these as a final filter.
