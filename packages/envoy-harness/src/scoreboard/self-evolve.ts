/**
 * SelfEvolve — the 5-step protocol (§13 of the design).
 *
 * **The 5 steps:**
 *
 * 1. **SNAPSHOT** — copy the current state (ruleset, scoreboard,
 *    AGENTS.md) into a versioned directory. The snapshot is the
 *    rollback target; a `reverted` entry leaves the snapshot
 *    untouched.
 *
 * 2. **HYPOTHESIZE** — the `HypothesisProvider` (a model, by
 *    default; a stub in tests) reads the recent failures from
 *    the scoreboard and proposes a new ruleset. The proposal is
 *    a FULL ruleset, not a patch — the protocol never operates
 *    on the live state.
 *
 * 3. **CANDIDATE** — write the proposed ruleset to
 *    `v<version>.candidate.json`. The candidate is immutable
 *    once written; if the cycle reverts, the live ruleset is
 *    unchanged.
 *
 * 4. **EVALUATE** — run the benchmark against both the current
 *    ruleset (baseline) and the candidate. The protocol keeps
 *    the candidate iff `candidate.passRate > baseline.passRate`
 *    (strict greater; ties are reverting to be conservative).
 *
 * **Candidates are rule SELECTIONS, not new rule bodies.** The
 * model proposes a (possibly reordered/subset) set of rule NAMES
 * from the current ruleset; `parseHypothesisFromLlm` resolves
 * them back to the real rule objects. v0 fabricated placeholder
 * always-pass `check` functions for names the model invented,
 * which made the "after" pass rate ~1.0 and the protocol always
 * "kept". Rule bodies remain code; evolution optimizes the rule
 * set, not the implementation.
 *
 * 5. **COMMIT / REVERT** — append a `ScoreboardEntry` to the
 *    scoreboard (the audit trail). If kept, copy the candidate
 *    over the live ruleset. If reverted, do nothing (the
 *    snapshot is the rollback target if a future cycle needs
 *    it).
 *
 * **Shadow mode:** the protocol can run without committing
 * changes. The scoreboard entry is still written (the entry's
 * `status: 'kept'` or `'reverted'` reflects what WOULD have
 * happened, not what did). This is how v0 lands: the operator
 * inspects the scoreboard to decide whether to enable
 * committing.
 *
 * **Contamination guard:** the hypothesis prompt is assembled
 * by `buildHypothesisPrompt`, which is tested explicitly to
 * confirm it does NOT include the benchmark or any private
 * data. The guard is enforced by the API — the prompt builder
 * is the only path to the model.
 *
 * **Stability:** the public API is `runOneCycle`, `snapshot`,
 * `proposeHypothesis`, `runBenchmark`, `commitCandidate`. All
 * are stable; new ones are additive.

 *   (the file is a bare array). This is a forward-compat
 *   concession for files written before this commit (none
 *   exist in production — the ruleset file just shipped
 *   in F14.1 / T1.3).
 *
 * **Why version the ruleset file:** the same forward-compat
 * argument as T1.2 (the persisted-session JSONL). v2+ may
 * add per-rule overrides (severity, weight, scope). v2+
 * may also embed the `check` body (instead of selecting
 * from `knownRules` by name). Pre-release is the right
 * time to add the field.
