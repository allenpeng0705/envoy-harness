/**
 * commandSemanticsValidation — sixth of the 6 bash validators.
 *
 * **Rule:** the command must be syntactically sane. Block if it has
 * unbalanced quotes or unescaped backticks.
 *
 * **Why this matters:** shell injection attacks often rely on
 * malformed quoting. A user typing `rm -rf /` is intentional; a
 * tool output that contains `"; rm -rf /` is suspicious. The
 * semantics validator catches the second kind.
 *
 * **Limitations:** this is a heuristic. It does not parse shell. A
 * user who writes `echo "hello"` with one missing closing quote is
 * blocked. A user who writes `printf '%s' "abc" "def"` (even count)
 * is allowed. False positives are rare; false negatives are caught
 * by the next layer (the actual shell will reject the malformed
 * command).
 *
 * **Design doc:** §6.2 of `docs/design.md`.

 * - outside quotes: backslash escapes the next character;
 * - a quote inside a differently-quoted region is literal
 *   (`"it's"` has a balanced apostrophe; the old char-count
 *   version blocked it as a false positive).
