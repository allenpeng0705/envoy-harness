/**
 * Minimal shell tokenizer for permission validation.
 *
 * **Why this exists:** the bash tool must hand `validateBash`
 * a real `argv` (the design says argv is "tokenized", but v0
 * passed `[]`, which made `pathValidation` a no-op). This
 * tokenizer splits a command string into shell words the way
 * `sh` would, well enough for path validation:
 *
 * - Splits on unquoted whitespace.
 * - Respects single quotes (no escapes inside).
 * - Respects double quotes (backslash escapes inside).
 * - Handles backslash escapes outside quotes.
 * - Quote characters are stripped (they are shell syntax, not
 *   part of the word).
 *
 * **What it does NOT do:** full POSIX shell parsing. No
 * handling of `$(...)` expansion semantics, heredocs, glob
 * expansion, or command substitution. `$HOME/x` stays a
 * literal token (path validation can't resolve variables —
 * documented limitation of the heuristic layer).
 *
 * **Stability:** the public surface is `tokenizeShellCommand`.
 * Additive.

/**
 * Split a shell command into words, stripping quotes and

 * tokenizeShellCommand(`cat "my file.txt"`)
 * // => ["cat", "my file.txt"]
 * tokenizeShellCommand(`echo a\\"b`)
 * // => ["echo", "a\\"b"]
