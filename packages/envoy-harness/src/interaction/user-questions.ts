/**
 * Phase A / Item 5 — the `UserQuestionService` (open-ended
 * user questions + approval delegation, the deepseek
 * `ctx.userQuestions` shape ported).
 *
 * **Reference:** deepseek `interaction/user-questions` +
 * `multiline support` (gap-closure-plan item 5).
 *
 * **Why a primitive:** the agent's runtime needs to ask the
 * human things ("which option?", "allow this?", "what's the
 * project root?"). The REPL handles this today via ad-hoc
 * readline calls scattered through `tool-executor.ts`; the
 * Tauri / mesh hosts will need the same capability. A single
 * service interface lets every host register its own provider
 * (REPL stdin today, Tauri composer tomorrow, mesh tomorrow
 * tomorrow) without forking the agent loop.
 *
 * **One active provider at a time:** the service is a
 * multiplexer, not a fan-out. The first registered provider
 * wins; a second registration throws (Q5 of the v1 design
 * notes — matches the existing `LocalRuntimeRegistry` shape).
 * This keeps the human's interaction surface unambiguous: one
 * channel, not several competing for the user's attention.
 *
 * **No-provider behavior:** when no provider is registered,
 * `ask()` returns `{ value: "", cancelled: true }` instead of
 * throwing. The model can fall through to its default
 * (e.g. approval "deny" is the safe default when no human is
 * available). This matches deepseek's `defaultProvider`
 * behavior + the existing v0 fallback contract.
 *
 * **Stable:** the `UserQuestionService` interface is a
 * Package-1 surface; new fields are additive, removing one
 * is a major version bump.
