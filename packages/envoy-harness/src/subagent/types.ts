/**
 * Sub-agent types (§10.3 of the design — F10.1 Phase 5).
 *
 * **What is this module?** the public type surface for
 * the mesh-native sub-agent integration. The parent
 * agent calls the `task` tool; the tool submits to a
 * `MeshSubmitter`; the submitter runs (or routes) the
 * sub-agent and returns the result.
 *
 * **Why a separate "sub-agent" abstraction, not just
 * "call Agent.run()":** the design invariant #9 says
 * "sub-agents map to mesh chain steps, not in-process
 * tasks". A sub-agent is a fresh session, even locally.
 * The `MeshSubmitter` seam makes that explicit: the
 * parent doesn't directly call `new Agent()`; the
 * submitter decides the sub-agent's session, model,
 * tools, permission, and (in the future) whether the
 * sub-agent runs locally or on a peer.
 *
 * **Why envoy-harness owns these types:** the `task`
 * tool is a first-class harness tool. The seam
 * (`MeshSubmitter`) is the *interface*; the
 * implementation (`LocalMeshSubmitter`) is the
 * *default*. Both live in Package 1. The future
 * `RemoteMeshSubmitter` (cross-node) can live in
 * the adapter (Package 3) — the seam doesn't change.
 *
 * **What this is NOT:**
 * - Not a fork pattern. The sub-agent is a NEW
 *   `Agent` instance with a NEW `InMemorySession`.
 *   It does not share the parent's session, hooks,
 *   or permission.
 * - Not a thread. JS is single-threaded; the
 *   "sub-agent runs in parallel" semantic is the
 *   host's concern (the host can `Promise.all` over
 *   multiple `submitter.submit()` calls if it wants
 *   concurrency).
 * - Not the F9.3 Team pattern. F9.3 Team is a
 *   pre-defined graph of agents in TOML, all
 *   sharing the parent's tool registry. F10.1
 *   sub-agents are dynamic, single-shot, with
 *   their own session.
 *
 * **Stability:** additive. New fields on
 * `SubagentInput` or `SubagentResult` are
 * additive; removing a field is a major version.

/**
 * F10.3.3: federated routing hint. The mesh uses
 * this to pick the right peer for the sub-agent.
 *
 * **The seam:** envoy-harness exposes the hint as
 * structured data. The actual routing decision
 * (which peer to send to, capability matching, load
 * balancing) lives in EnvoyMesh — NOT in
 * envoy-harness. Per the boundary doc
 * (`docs/boundary.{en,zh}.md`): "Routing is a mesh
 * concern; envoy-harness exposes the hint, EnvoyMesh
 * decides the target."
 *
 * **Why structured, not opaque `Record<string, unknown>`:**
 * TypeScript users get IDE autocomplete + type
 * checking. The host can still pass extra fields
 * via the `SubagentInput.routingHint as
 * Partial<RoutingHint>` escape hatch if the mesh
 * adds new fields before envoy-harness picks them
 * up. The mesh can also pass through unknown
 * fields unchanged.
 *
 * **v0 (this commit):** the type is defined; the
 * fields are advisory. `LocalMeshSubmitter` ignores
 * them (no peer selection). `RemoteMeshSubmitter`
 * passes them through to the transport; the
 * transport (host-injected, mesh-side) interprets
 * them. Future: a `FanOutSpec` (F10.4+) can
 * pre-populate `routingHint` from the parent's
 * perspective.
 *
 * **What envoy-harness does NOT do:** peer scoring,
 * load balancing, capability matching, fallback
 * selection. All of that is a mesh concern; the
 * mesh-side transport (or the orchestrator above
 * the transport) makes the call.
