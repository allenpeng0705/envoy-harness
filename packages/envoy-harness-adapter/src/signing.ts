/**
 * F8.4+ — `defaultSignResult` helper.
 *
 * The adapter takes `signResult` as a DI closure (per
 * the `AgentAdapter` contract). v0's tests inject a
 * fake that stamps a SHA-256 of the canonical JSON.
 * Production needs real Ed25519 — that's what this
 * module provides.
 *
 * **Why a helper, not a built-in default:** the adapter
 * is runtime-agnostic. It does not import any app-level
 * module. The host provides the signing key. This
 * helper is the *convenience* — call `defaultSignResult(key.privateKeyPem)`
 * once when constructing the adapter, get a closure
 * that does real Ed25519.
 *
 * **What gets signed:** `signCanonicalPayload(input, key)`
 * signs the canonical JSON of `input`. The protocol
 * doc says "the signature covers it so a malicious
 * adapter cannot retroactively edit it" — meaning
 * `raw` is part of what's signed. The full unsigned
 * `AgentResult` (with `raw`) is what we pass to
 * `signCanonicalPayload`, so the signature covers
 * everything.
 *
 * **Stability:** the public surface is `defaultSignResult`.
 * Additive; the helper is in addition to the adapter's
 * existing DI surface.
