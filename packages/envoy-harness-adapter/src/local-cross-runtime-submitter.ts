/**
 * Phase 8 Step 2 — `LocalCrossRuntimeSubmitter` in Package 3.
 *
 * **What this is:** the standard `MeshSubmitter` implementation
 * for sub-agents that run on a *local* but *different* runtime
 * (not envoy-harness). Today the only other runtime is
 * Built-in OpenClaw; future runtimes (Pi, HomeClaw, Hermes)
 * slot in via the same `LocalRuntimeBridge` seam.
 *
 * **Lives in Package 3** (the bridge) per the (B) plan's
 * open-question 2: "LocalCrossRuntimeSubmitter location —
 * envoy-harness-adapter (Option 1) OR EnvoyMesh apps/node/src/
 * (Option 2)? Lean toward Option 1 (bridge owns it) for the
 * same reason Q1 = C: keep envoy-harness clean of per-runtime
 * knowledge." This file does NOT import OpenClaw's protocol —
 * the bridge wraps a `LocalRuntimeBridge` interface that the
 * host (EnvoyMesh) implements with whatever ask path it has.
 *
 * **The seam:** `LocalRuntimeBridge` is a host-injected
 * `submitToOpenClaw(input, signal)` closure. envoy-harness-adapter
 * doesn't know what's inside; the host plugs in the OpenClaw
 * ask path. Same DI pattern as `RemoteMeshSubmitter`'s
 * `RemoteSubmitterTransport`.
 *
 * **Routing rule:** when `input.preferredRuntime` is
 * `"envoy-harness"` (or undefined), the submitter delegates to
 * the inner `LocalMeshSubmitter` (default — same-process
 * sub-agent in a fresh local session). When `preferredRuntime`
 * is `"openclaw"`, it routes through the bridge. Unknown
 * runtimes throw — strict "fail loud" for misconfiguration
 * (Q1 — design invariants favor explicit over implicit).
 *
 * **Result shape:** the bridge's `submitToOpenClaw` returns a
 * `SubagentResult`. We pass it through unchanged. The
 * `workerRuntime` is rewritten to `"openclaw"` so the parent
 * (and any downstream verifier) knows which runtime produced
 * the result. The signature is left as the bridge produced it
 * (empty for cross-runtime in v0; the cross-runtime delegation
 * is in-process so no cryptographic trust is needed — same
 * v0 semantics as `LocalMeshSubmitter`).
 *
 * **Stability:** the public surface is
 * `LocalCrossRuntimeSubmitter` (class) +
 * `LocalCrossRuntimeSubmitterOptions` (constructor opts) +
 * `LocalRuntimeBridge` (interface). Additive; new methods on
 * the bridge are backward-compatible; new constructor options
 * are optional.

 * EnvoyMesh (see `apps/node/src/agent-runtime-envoy/local-runtime-registry.ts`).
 *
 * **Why an interface, not a class:** the adapter should not
 * know about OpenClaw's ask path. The host injects a closure
 * that closes over `askOpenClaw` (from `NodeServiceImpl`) or
 * any other ask path. Same pattern as `RemoteSubmitterTransport`.
 *
 * **The closure receives:** the `SubagentInput` + the parent's
 * `AbortSignal`. The closure returns a `SubagentResult`. The
 * adapter doesn't re-validate; the host's implementation owns
 * the result shape.
 *
 * **Why the closure is sync-typed (Promise return):** all
 * cross-runtime sub-agent paths are async (network or
 * inter-process IPC), even local ones. The interface reflects
 * that.

 *
 * **Why a class, not a function:** the parent's
 * `AgentOptions.meshSubmitter` expects a `MeshSubmitter`
 * (interface with a `submit` method). A class is the natural
 * shape; future state (caching, retry, etc.) is additive
 * without breaking the interface.

 * **The interface contract:** `submit(input, signal)` returns
