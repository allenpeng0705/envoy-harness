/**
 * F10.3.2: `RemoteMeshSubmitter` — the cross-node `MeshSubmitter`.
 *
 * **What this is:** the standard `MeshSubmitter` implementation
 * for sub-agents that run on a remote worker node (not locally).
 * Lives in Package 3 (`envoy-harness-adapter`) because the
 * cross-node concern is at the mesh boundary — the package
 * boundary doc (`docs/boundary.{en,zh}.md`) says
 * "envoy-harness-adapter is the ONLY place that knows about
 * both envoy-harness and the mesh."
 *
 * **The transport seam:** the host injects a
 * `RemoteSubmitterTransport`. The transport is the thing that
 * actually talks to the mesh (libp2p, the wire envelope, the
 * peer routing). The submitter is a thin wrapper: it just
 * forwards `submit()` → `transport.send()` and returns the
 * result. **The transport owns all crypto** (parent request
 * signing + worker result verification); envoy-harness-adapter
 * doesn't know about Ed25519, secp256k1, etc. — same DI pattern
 * as F8's `defaultSignResult`.
 *
 * **Why the transport is opaque:** the result returned by
 * `transport.send()` is `SubagentResult` with the worker's
 * signature in `signature` (already verified by the transport).
 * The submitter doesn't re-verify. The host's transport
 * implementation closes over the worker's public key + the
 * parent's private key (for request signing).
 *
 * **No default transport.** Unlike F8's `defaultBuildAgent` /
 * `defaultSignResult`, F10.3.2 doesn't ship a default
 * `RemoteSubmitterTransport`. v0: the host (Tauri app, CLI)
 * provides one. The transport implementation lives in EnvoyMesh
 * (the sibling monorepo) — it knows the mesh protocol.
 *
 * **Result signature is mandatory.** The `SubagentResult.signature`
 * field is non-empty after the transport returns. The
 * `LocalMeshSubmitter` (Package 1) leaves it empty for local
 * sub-agents (no trust boundary); the `RemoteMeshSubmitter` only
 * works when the transport produces a signed result. The
 * transport is responsible for this.
 *
 * **Stability:** the public surface is `RemoteMeshSubmitter`
 * (class) + `RemoteMeshSubmitterOptions` (constructor opts) +
 * `RemoteSubmitterTransport` (interface). Additive; new fields
 * don't break existing callers.

/**
 * F10.3.2: the cross-node transport seam. The host injects an
 * implementation; envoy-harness-adapter doesn't ship one.
 *
 * **What the transport does:**
 * 1. Signs the request with the parent's private key
 *    (so the worker knows the request is from a known
 *    parent; the worker verifies with the parent's
 *    public key).
 * 2. Sends the request over the mesh to the target peer
 *    (libp2p, circuit relay, etc.).
 * 3. Receives the worker's response (a `SubagentResult`
 *    with `signature` filled in by the worker).
 * 4. Verifies the worker's signature using the worker's
 *    public key (so the parent knows the response is from
 *    the claimed worker).
 * 5. Returns the verified `SubagentResult`.
 *
 * **Why the transport does the crypto:** envoy-harness-adapter
 * is a thin bridge; it doesn't import a crypto library. The
 * transport closes over whatever crypto the host uses
 * (Ed25519, HMAC, etc.). Same pattern as F8's
 * `defaultSignResult` — the closure hides the implementation.
 *
 * **Why the result already has `signature`:** the worker signs
 * the result BEFORE returning it. The transport carries the
 * signature back as part of the `SubagentResult` (the
 * `signature` field). The parent (envoy-harness-adapter)
 * doesn't re-verify; the transport already did.
 *
 * **Abort:** the transport MUST honor the `signal`. When
 * the parent aborts, the transport should cancel the
 * in-flight send/recv and throw an `AbortError` (or
 * similar). The submitter propagates the error.
