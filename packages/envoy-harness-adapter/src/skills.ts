/**
 * ENVOY_HARNESS_SKILLS — the catalog of skills this adapter
 * advertises on the mesh.
 *
 * **Design doc:** `docs/improving-agent-network.en.md` §5.2
 * (in the EnvoyMesh monorepo) + envoy-harness's own design
 * §11. The 5 skills map to envoy-harness's local tool
 * surface (read_file + bash).
 *
 * **Skill → tool mapping:** each skill is a thin wrapper
 * over a known tool composition. The adapter's
 * `EnvoyHarnessAdapter.execute()` reads `getToolsForSkill()`
 * to know which local tools to expose. The mapping is
 * **adapter-internal** — the wire format doesn't know
 * about local tools; only the adapter does.
 *
 * **Sensitivity:** `public` means "anyone on the mesh
 * can call this"; `friends` means "owners I'm bonded
 * with"; `private` means "only me". envoy-harness v0
 * defaults everything to `private` (the harness is the
 * home-team agent; we don't expose skills to the open
 * mesh). A future chunk can lift this when the user
 * explicitly opts in to a friend network.
 *
 * **Cost ceiling:** soft signal only. The orchestrator's
 * `chain-budget-ledger` is the authoritative gate.
 * envoy-harness's per-call cap (`--max-cost-usd`,
 * F7.5) is the second line of defense.
 *
 * **Stability:** the catalog is the public surface.
 * Adding new skills is additive; removing one is a
 * breaking change (it'd orphan in-flight tasks).

  // the algorithm; the adapter just advertises the
  // skill for the manifest + per-skill tool mapping.
  //
  // **Why `private`:** these skills are mesh-touching
  // and operate on the local node's trust + relay
  // state. Exposing them on the open mesh would
  // let any node trigger a bond request or read the
  // local relay book. v0 keeps them `private` (the

  // **Cost ceiling:** the bridge's own algorithm
  // (search → join → hello → wait) can run for

  // signal; the orchestrator's `chain-budget-ledger`
  // is the authoritative gate. v0 sets conservative
  // ceilings (sponsor-friend is the most expensive
