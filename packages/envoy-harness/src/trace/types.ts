/**
 * Trace types (§19 of the design — F9.4 Phase 4 feature).
 *
 * **What is this module?** the public type surface for the
 * trace observability layer. The agent emits a stream of
 * `TraceEvent`s at key points; a `Tracer` implementation
 * decides what to do with them (the CLI's `--json` flag
 * wires a `JsonLinesTracer` to stdout).
 *
 * **Why a discriminated union:** each event kind has a
 * different shape (agent_start has sessionId + tools;
 * tool_result has durationMs + result). A union forces
 * the consumer to handle each kind explicitly; the
 * `kind` field is the discriminator.
 *
 * **`ts` field:** every event carries an ISO 8601
 * timestamp. We use `new Date().toISOString()` rather
 * than `process.hrtime` so the trace is human-readable.
 * Sub-millisecond ordering is not part of the contract.
 *
 * **What this is NOT:**
 * - Not a logging system. The `Logger` field on
 *   `StdioLspClient` is for internal diagnostics; the
 *   trace is for user-observable events.
 * - Not a metrics system. Token counts and cost are
 *   included in `agent_end` but not every event.
 *   v0 doesn't ship histograms; that's downstream.
 *
 * **Stability:** additive. New event kinds are added
 * over time. Consumers should switch on `kind` and
 * have a default branch (forward-compat).

  /**
   * F10.6: the parent session id, when this event
   * was emitted by a SUB-agent. The PARENT's own
   * events have no `subagentOf` (the parent is the
   * root; its `sessionId` IS the root).
   *
   * **Why a field, not consumer-side inference:**
   * when multiple sub-agents run in parallel
   * (F10.2 fan-out), their events interleave with
   * the parent's events. A consumer that wants to
   * group events by session has to infer the
   * attribution from event ordering — fragile,
   * breaks when the parent has multiple "bursts"
   * of sub-agent activity. With `subagentOf`, the
   * attribution is in the data: a consumer filters
   * or groups by `subagentOf` without inferring.
   *
   * **What it points to:** the parent's `sessionId`
   * (the `AgentStartEvent.sessionId` of the parent's
   * `agent_start` event). The sub-agent's own
   * `sessionId` is the CHILD's id (the value at
   * `AgentStartEvent.sessionId` when the sub-agent
   * starts); `subagentOf` points UP to the parent.
   *
   * **Self-describing events:** with `subagentOf`,
   * every event carries its full provenance. A
   * Tauri UI showing a session tree, a log analyzer
   * filtering by session, or a replay tool
   * attributing events — all work without consumer-
   * side inference.
   *
   * **Optional:** the parent's own events omit
   * `subagentOf`. Consumers should treat missing as
   * "this is a root event (parent)" and present as
   * such. Existing consumers (F9.4 `JsonLinesTracer`,
   * the CLI's `--json` flag) ignore the field.
