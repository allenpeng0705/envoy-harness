/**
 * NullTracer — a `Tracer` that does nothing.
 *
 * **Why this exists:** the agent always needs a `Tracer`
 * (the field can't be `undefined` at the call sites
 * because then every `tracer.emit` needs a guard). A
 * no-op default is cleaner than optional chaining at
 * every call site.
 *
 * **Zero overhead:** `emit` is an empty method. v8
 * inlines trivially.
 *
 * **Stability:** the public surface is `NullTracer`
 * (class). Additive.
