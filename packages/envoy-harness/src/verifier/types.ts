/**
 * Verifier types (§12 of the design).
 *
 * **What is a verifier?** A function that judges whether a
 * worker's output actually answers the user's objective. The
 * verifier produces a `Verdict`: `pass`, `partial`, `fail`, or
 * `disputed`. Multiple verdicts from different sources
 * (rules, LLM, human, cross-agent) are combined.
 *
 * **Three layers of trust:**
 *
 * 1. **Local rules** (this module). Fast, deterministic, free.
 *    Six rules per design §12.1.
 *
 * 2. **LLM source** (Phase 2). The verifier is a separate,
 *    cheaper LLM that reads the worker's output and judges it.
 *    See design §12.3.
 *
 * 3. **Human / cross-agent** (Phase 4). Owner-signed review,
 *    or a parallel run on a different model.
 *
 * **Why rules first?** The 6 rules catch 80% of the obvious
 * failures (empty output, sandbox violations, etc.) without an
 * LLM round-trip. LLM verification is the escalation path,
 * not the default.
 *
 * **Stability:** `VerifierRule` and `runVerifierRules` are the
 * public API. Adding a rule is additive; removing one is a
 * major version bump.
